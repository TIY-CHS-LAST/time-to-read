On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced

into Congress a resolution,(adopted on July 2)

which asserted that <i>these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, fee

and independent States</i>. While this resolution was being discussed,on June

11 a committee,

consisting of John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Robert R.

Livingston , and Roger Sherman was appointed to

 draft a Declaration of Independence.



In his Autobiography written in 1805,

Adams states that the committee of five decided upon "which the declaration

was to consist", and it then appointed Jefferson and himself to form a

subcommittee to really write them down. Now Jefferson and Adams have two

completely different versions of what happened then. Adams says:<br>

<blockquote><i>

Jefferson proposed to me to make the draught, I said I will not; You shall do

it. Oh no! Why will you not? You ought to do it. I will not. Why? Reasons

enough. What can be your reasons? Reason 1st. You are a Virginian and a

Virginian ough to appear at the head of this business. Reason 2nd. I am

obnoxious, suspected and unpopular; you are very much otherwise. Reason 3rd.

You can write ten times better than I can. 'Well", said Jefferson, 'if you are

decided I will do as well as I can'. Very well, when you have drawnit up we

will have a meeting.</i></blockquote>

Jefferson's version is completely different. In a letter to Maddison of 1823

he writes:

<i><blockquote>

Mr. Adams memory has led him into unquestionable error. At the age of 88 and

47 years after the transactions, . . . this is not wonderful. Nor should I . .

. venture to oppose my memory to his, were it not supported by written notes,

taken by myself at the moment and on the spot. . . The Committee of 5 met, no

such thing as a sub-committee was proposed, but they unanimously pressed on

myself alone to undertake the draught. I consented; I drew it; but before I

reported it to the committee I communicated it separately to Dr. Franklin and

Mr. Adams requesting their corrections;. . . and you have seen the original

paper now in my hands, with the corrections of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams

interlined in their own handwriting. Their alterations were two or three only,

and merely verbal. I then wrote a fair copy, reported it to the committee, and

from them, unaltered to the Congress.</i></blockquote>

<a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php">The draft</a> was presented to Congress on June 28 and

adopted by Congress on July 4,

after a number of changes had been made. There are no journals on the debates

and the amendments. The most important of these were the

excision of a <A HREF="javascript:footnote('This passage, Jefferson wrote at the time, <i>was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves, and who on the contrary wished to continue it. Our Northern brethern also I believe felt a little tender under those censures, for tho\' their people have very few slaves themselves yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others.</i>')">passage</a> indicting the slave trade and

a number of passages were reworded in a more pious form..

A formal parchment copy of the Declaration, adopted in Congress 4 July 1776,

 was available for signing on

August 2, and most of the 55 signatures were inscribed upon it on that


<A HREF="javascript:footnote('As late as November, Matthew Thornton of New Hampshire, recently elected to Congress, became the last to sign the Declaration of Independence.')">date</a>.

The intention of the Declaration, Jefferson later wrote, was not saying some-

thing new, but <blockquote> <i>to place before mankind the common sense of the

subject, in

terms so plain and firm as to command their assent... Neither aiming at

originality of principles or sentiments, nor yet copied from any particular

and previous writing, it was intended to be an expression of the American

mind.</i></blockquote>

<a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php">Draft version of the Declaration of Independence, June 28,

1776</a>

<p>There is still another version of the text, the so-called Lee-version. This

is the text that Jefferson sent to Lee. This may be a better version of the

draft. See Carl L. Becker, <i>The declaration of independence. A

study in the history of political ideas</i> (New York, 1922) page 174.

<p>One of the inspirations for the American Declaration of Independence was the <a href="../before-1600/plakkaat-van-verlatinghe-1581-july-26.php">Plakkaat van Verlatinghe of 1581</a> in which the Dutch abjured the King of Spain as their sovereign.</p>

   <a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#par1">

   When, in the course of human events,</a> it becomes necessary for one

   people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with

   another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate

   and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God

   entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that

   they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.



<p>

<a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#par2"> We hold these truths to be

self-evident</a>, that all men are created

   equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable

   rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

   That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men,

   deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That

   whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is

   the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new

   government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its

   powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their

   safety and happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments

   long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;

   and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more

   disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by

   abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long

   train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object

   evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their

   right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new

   guards for their future security.  --



<p>

<a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#par3">Such has been the patient </a>sufferance    of these

colonies; and such is now

   the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of

   government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history

   of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the

   establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.  To prove this, let

   facts be submitted to a candid world.

<p>

       He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary

   for the public good.

<p>       He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and

   pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent

   should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to

   attend to them.

<p>       He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large

   districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of

   representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and

   formidable to tyrants only.



<p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable,

   and distant from the depository of their public records, for the

   sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.



     <p>He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with

   manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

<p><a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#par4"> He has refused </a>for a long time, after such

dissolutions, to cause others

   to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation,

   have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state

   remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from

   without, and convulsions within.

<p>      He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that

   purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing

   to pass others to encourage their migration hither,  and raising the

   conditions of new appropriations of lands.

<p><a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#par5"> He has obstructed</a> the administration of

justice, by refusing his assent

   to laws for establishing judiciary powers.


<p>       He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of

   their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

<p><a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#offices">  He has erected</a> a multitude of new

offices, and sent hither swarms of

   officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.

<p><a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#ships">  He has kept among us</a>, in times of peace,

standing armies without the

   consent of our legislature.

<p>       He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to

   civil power.

<p>  <a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#combined"> He has combined</a> with others to subject

us to a jurisdiction foreign to

   our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to

   their acts of pretended legislation:

<ul>

<li>   For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

<li>   For protecting them, by mock trial, from punishment for any murders

   which  they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:

<li>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:

<li>   For imposing taxes on us without our consent:

<li>   For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury:

<li>   For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses:

<li>    For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring

   province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging

   its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for

   introducing the same absolute rule in these colonies:

<li><a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#charters">       For taking away our charters,

abolishing our most valuable laws, and

   altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:

<li>       For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves

   invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.


</ul>

<p><a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#abdicated">

       He has abdicated government</a> here, by declaring us out of his

   protection and waging war against us.

<p>       He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burned our towns,

   and destroyed the lives of our people.

<p><a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#armies">  He is at this time transporting

large armies</a> of foreign mercenaries to

   complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun

   with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the

   most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized

   nation.

<p>       He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas

   to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their

   friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.

<p>   <a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#indians"> He has excited domestic </a>insurrections

amongst us, and has endeavored

   to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian

   savages, whose known rule of warfare, is undistinguished destruction

   of all ages, sexes and conditions.


<br><a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#slavery"><i>In Jefferson's draft there is a part

on slavery here</i></a>

<p> <a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#in"> In every stage of these oppressions</a> we have

petitioned for redress in

   the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered

   only by repeated injury.  A prince, whose character is thus marked by

   every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free

   people.

<p> <a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#nor"> Nor have we been wanting</a> in attention to our

British brethren.  We

   have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to

   extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.  We have reminded them

   of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.  We have

   appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have

   conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these

   usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and

   correspondence.  We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which

   denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of

   mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.

<p>

<p><a href="jeffersons-draft-of-the-declaration-of-independence.php#slot"> We, therefore, the representatives of the United

States of America, in

   General Congress, assembled, appealing to</a> the Supreme Judge of the

   world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the

   authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and

   declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and

   independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the

   British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the

   state of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as

   free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude

   peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts

   and things which independent states may of right do.  And for the support

   of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine

   Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes

   and our sacred honor.
